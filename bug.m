In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.

Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
- (void)someMethod {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    [obj someMethodThatRetainsAnObject]; // This method retains another object
    [obj release]; // This releases obj, but what about the object retained within obj?
}
```

The issue:  `[obj release]` decrements the retain count of `obj`, but it does *not* release any objects that `obj` might have retained.  If `someMethodThatRetainsAnObject` increased the retain count of another object, that object's memory won't be deallocated until its own retain count reaches zero.  This can lead to memory leaks if not handled correctly.

Another example often involves delegates:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) id <MyObjectDelegate> delegate;
@end

- (void)someMethod {
  MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
  obj.delegate = someDelegateObject;
  [obj release]; // delegate not released
}
```

Here, even though `obj` is released, `someDelegateObject` remains retained by `obj`, resulting in a memory leak.
